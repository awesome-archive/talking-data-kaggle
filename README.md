## TalkingData Kaggle Competition

This is an effort to compete in the [TalkingData kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics)


### Methodology

Our current effort is going to be a rather simple solution.
We will import the data into postgres to make it easier to manipulate, then create
feature vectors for each device (how TBD) and then run that through a random forrest.
